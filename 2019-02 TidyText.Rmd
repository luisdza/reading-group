# 00. Introduction to my notes

The book we're reading is Text Mining with R by Julia Silge and David Robinson.

An online version of the book can be found at: https://www.tidytextmining.com/

I propose we do 1 chapter a week, see proposed dates below.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
x <- data.frame("No" = 1:9,
                "Chapter Name" = c("The tidy text format",
                                    "Sentiment analysis with tidy data",
                                    "Analyzing word and document frequency: tf-idf",
                                    "Relationships between words: n-grams and correlations",
                                    "Converting to and from non-tidy formats",
                                    "Topic modelling",
